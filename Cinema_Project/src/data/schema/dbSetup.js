		"description": "It's man versus ape in the final bloodbath that will determine the fate of the entire world. There's two choices: cooperate or destroy. And it's clear which decision has been made. This time, it's war. The humans believe there is no place for the apes within modern society ï¿½ their way of life is primitive and different, and they can't be trusted to integrate peacefully. So, they only have one aim: exterminate them. The apes, led by Caesar (Andy Serkis), are forced into a bitter bloodbath, virtually helpless against the advanced weaponry that the humans possess. Caesar watches as his friends and family are slaughtered, and a new resolve takes over. Somewhere deep within him, the animal is awoken. A fresh hatred grips Caesar and he sets out to destroy the man (Woody Harrelson) who has led the war which will destroy his species. During his quest, Caesar wrestles to stop the rage he feels from taking over his own glimmer of humanity, as he risks truly becoming the monster that the humans see him as. When man and ape finally face each other, the future of both species hangs in the balance. Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) directs the third instalment of the franchise, set in a sci-fi universe that has gripped audiences since the first film was released in 1968. The modern adaptation features the incredible Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings franchise, alongside Woody Harrelson (The Hunger Games franchise) as the cold-blooded colonel.
