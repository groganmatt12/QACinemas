Friday report:

Matt: - attempting to build MovieListing.jsx file and importing MovieDetails.json details.
      - stopped while trying to import movie details from .json file.
      - 
Andrew: - viewport (vm/vw) vs EM. 
vw/vh is a percentage width/height of the viewport. For example: 10vh = 10% of viewport.
EM is proportional to the parents elements font size. 
(See answer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34953044/in-css-what-is-the-difference-between-vw-and-em for clarification). 
Use 'rem' to refer to direct parent only.
